**Project Description: Huffman Coding for File Compression and Decompression**

**Overview:**
The Huffman coding project aims to implement a file compression and decompression system using the Huffman coding algorithm. Huffman coding is a widely used technique for lossless data compression, especially for text files. The project provides functionalities to compress text files into a more compact representation and decompress them back to their original form.

**Key Features:**

1. **File Compression:**
   - The project allows users to compress text files using the Huffman coding algorithm.
   - Huffman coding is a prefix-free encoding technique that assigns variable-length codes to different characters based on their frequencies in the input text.
   - During compression, the project analyzes the input text to determine the frequency of each character and constructs a Huffman tree.
   - The Huffman tree is then used to generate a mapping of characters to their corresponding Huffman codes, where more frequent characters are assigned shorter codes and less frequent characters are assigned longer codes.
   - The compressed output is generated by replacing each character in the input text with its Huffman code, resulting in a more compact representation of the original text.

2. **File Decompression:**
   - The project also provides functionality to decompress previously compressed text files.
   - During decompression, the project reconstructs the original text from the compressed output using the same Huffman tree that was used for compression.
   - Each Huffman code in the compressed output is decoded back to its corresponding character, effectively restoring the original text.

3. **Efficient Storage:**
   - Huffman coding ensures efficient storage of data by assigning shorter codes to more frequent characters, leading to better compression ratios for text files with repetitive patterns or frequent characters.
   - The project leverages this property of Huffman coding to achieve significant reductions in file size while preserving the original text's content.

**Implementation Details:**

1. **Huffman Tree Construction:**
   - The project constructs a Huffman tree based on the frequency of characters in the input text.
   - This tree is built using a priority queue or heap data structure, where characters with lower frequencies have higher priorities.
   - The project combines nodes with the lowest frequencies to create parent nodes until a single root node is formed, representing the entire Huffman tree.

2. **Code Generation:**
   - After constructing the Huffman tree, the project generates a mapping of characters to their corresponding Huffman codes.
   - These codes are obtained by traversing the Huffman tree and assigning binary codes to each character based on the path from the root to the leaf node containing the character.
   - The resulting mapping is used during both compression and decompression to encode and decode text efficiently.

3. **File I/O Operations:**
   - The project handles reading input text files for compression and writing compressed output files.
   - Similarly, it reads compressed input files for decompression and writes the decompressed text to output files.
   - The project ensures seamless integration with file systems, allowing users to compress and decompress text files stored on their devices.

**Usage:**
To use the Huffman coding project:
1. Input a text file to be compressed.
2. Execute the compression algorithm to generate a compressed output file.
3. Optionally, store or transmit the compressed file.
4. When needed, input the compressed file into the decompression algorithm to recover the original text.

**Benefits:**
- **Space Efficiency:** Huffman coding achieves efficient compression, reducing the storage space required for text files.
- **Lossless Compression:** The project ensures lossless compression, meaning the original text can be perfectly reconstructed from the compressed output.
- **Versatility:** The project can handle various types of text files, making it suitable for a wide range of applications, including data storage, transmission, and archival.

**Conclusion:**
The Huffman coding project provides a reliable and efficient solution for file compression and decompression, leveraging the principles of Huffman coding to achieve space-efficient storage and transmission of text data while preserving its integrity. By implementing this project, users can benefit from reduced file sizes without sacrificing the accuracy or readability of their text documents.
